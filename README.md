# BikeSharingHw
*  I read plain text delimited data into pandas
* I prepared data for analysis
* I used EDA to learn about the bike sharing data and how the weather affected the rider counts
With the clean data I:
* explored the distribution of riders
* explored the relationship between time and rider counts
* and explored the relationship between weather and rider counts.
